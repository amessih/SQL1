 /*
 
I have learn a lot after this project. Not only about coding, but business mindset. What have I learn from answering each question: 

Question 1: Which products should we order more of or less of?
6 out of  top 10 products that need to be restocked are classic cars. We can see this is the top performance products to keep an eye for. 

Question 2:  How should we match marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?
- For top 5 VIP customers, in order to maintain the good relationship with them, we can develop loyatly program or exclusive events for them. 
- For top 5 less engaging customers, to bring them back more frequently, we can offer some incentive programs or increasing the customer interaction via email, calls and direct customer support. 

Question 3: How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?
We know that for each customer which brings us Â£39.039 (net profit). In order to determine how much within that CLV to spend for acquiring a new customer, it also depends on the costs of sales and marketing. 
However, we can see the potential of each customer profit so we can make a business plan for getting new more customer every quarter/year/month.
